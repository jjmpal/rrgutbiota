# Association Between Gut Microbiota and Blood Pressure in a Population Cohort of 6953 Individuals

## Background

Several small-scale animal studies have suggested that gut microbiota, assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplification, and blood pressure (BP) are linked. However, results from human studies remain scarce and partially conflicting. Our goal was to elucidate the association between the gut metagenome and BP in a large, representative, well-phenotyped population sample while adjusting for relevant confounders.
